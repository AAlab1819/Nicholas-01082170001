## 230A DRAGONS

1.first input the kiritoStr for kirito strength and input numDragon for how many dragons

2.then we input the dragonStr for how many strength in each dragon and input bonus for each dragon if killed got the bonus point

3.dragonStr and bonus i make it to array 0 1 2 3 .....

4.then i sort the dragonStr with bubble sort technique and the bonus array index will change along with the dragonStr

5.after the sorting then i make a algorithm for addition the bonus point,for loop= if the kiritoStr > dragonStr[i] , kiritoStr +bonus[i], and make bool finals to true for preparation in the end

6.then else if the kiritoStr <  dragonStr[i] (inside the for loop too) , kirito can't defeat the dragon and set the bool finals to false.

7.if the for loop is done and the bool finals is true cout yes and cout no for the bool finals false
